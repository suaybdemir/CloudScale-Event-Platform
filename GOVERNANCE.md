# Project Governance

## 1. Authority and Roadmap

The **Project Owner** retains full authority over the technical direction, roadmap, and acceptance criteria of this project.

*   **Roadmap Ownership**: The roadmap is determined solely by the Project Owner based on architectural goals and personal discretion.
*   **Contribution Acceptance**: The Project Owner is not obligated to accept contributions, even if they are technically sound or pass all tests. Features that deviate from the core vision may be rejected without detailed justification.
*   **Veto Power**: The Project Owner retains absolute veto power on all architectural decisions, including but not limited to technology selection, dependency additions, and API design.

## 2. Decision Making

We value community input, but this is a **governed** repository, not a consensus-driven democracy.

### Architectural Decision Records (ADR)
Significant changes (e.g., adding a new infrastructure component like a database or message broker) must be preceded by an approved ADR.
*   **Proposals**: Anyone may propose an ADR via an Issue.
*   **Approval**: Only the Project Owner can approve an ADR.
*   **Implementation**: Code submitted without a prior approved ADR for architectural changes will be closed.

## 3. Relicensing Rights

By contributing to this repository, you acknowledge and agree that:

1.  **Current License**: Your contribution is accepted under the **CC BY-NC 4.0** license.
2.  **Future Relicensing**: The Project Owner reserves the right to relicense **future versions** of the project under different terms (e.g., dual-licensing).
3.  **Existing Contributions**: Your contributions to the version in which they were accepted remain under the license terms applicable at the time of acceptance (CC BY-NC 4.0).

## 4. Commercial Restrictions

This project is strictly **Non-Commercial**.
*   Any attempt to "capture" the project for commercial gain (e.g., wrapping it in a paid SaaS, selling support contracts without authorization) is a violation of the license and the governance model.
*   The Project Owner monitors the ecosystem for license violations.
